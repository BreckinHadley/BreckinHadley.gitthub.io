    "title": "Analysis of the original Star Wars Trilogy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This mini project uses text analysis and sentiment scoring to analyze the scripts of the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes 4–6). By breaking up the dialogue and analyzing it using differnt sentiments (Bing, NRC, and AFINN), we can see the different trends in how emotions, word choice, and character dialogue changes throughout the original trilogy.\nThe project focuses on several questions: What words in the movies wave the highest positive or negative connotation? How are specific emotions, like fear and trust, expressed throughout the trilogy? Which characters have the most lines, and what words do they use the most? How does the emotional tone change throughout each movie, and how do the three movies compare to each other?\nNegative and Positive Sentiment Scores (Eps. 4-6):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this plot I want to know the top 10 most frequent positive words and top 10 most frequent negative words used in Star Wars Episodes 4-6.\nFear and Trust Sentiment Scores (Eps. 4-6):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights: This plot produces similar results as the plot above but looks at the top 10 most frequent trusting words and top 10 most frequent fearful words used in Star Wars Episodes 4-6.\nWord Lengths in Star Wars Dialogue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights: This plot shows how the word length compares to the sentiment while also showing what letter the word starts with. It seems that words that start with f,g,h, and i tend to have a more positive connotation while words starting with s,t,u,v have a more negative connotation.\nTop 10 Characters by Number of Lines in the Original Star Wars Trilogy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights: I wanted to compare the number of lines differnt characters had in Star Wars episodes 4-6. I decided to pick the top 10 characters with the most lines and display them on a horizonatal histogram.\nThis plot is a horizontal bar chart titled “Top 10 Characters by Number of Lines in the Original Star Wars Trilogy.” On the x-axis is the lists characters making the top 10, and on the y-axis we have the number of lines that character speaks through out the trilogy. The horizontal bars are colored green (like Lukes Lightsaber) and the characters are ordered from most lines at the top to least lines at the bottom. The character with the most lines in the trilogy is Luke and the character with the tenth most lines is Biggs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Most Frequent Non-Stop Words\n\n\nStar Wars Dialogue Analysis\n\n\nWord\nCount\n\n\n\n\nluke\n132\n\n\nsir\n91\n\n\nartoo\n84\n\n\nchewie\n65\n\n\nship\n57\n\n\ntime\n56\n\n\nmaster\n52\n\n\nfather\n51\n\n\nvader\n51\n\n\nforce\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights: For this code I wanted to find which word was said the most by each character. I had to account for stop_word (the,and,I,me, etc) but this were easily filtered out using anti_join.\nTheme throughtout the Trilogy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights: This plot was one of my favorites to make. This is a sentiment trajectory plot for each Star Wars movie which basically shows the emotional trajectory for each of the films. All of the films seem to be relatively similar to one another with one not being dratically differnt from the others."

    "text": "These choropleth maps use state level data to illustrate pollution (micro grams per cubic) and the second data set looks at the wildfire risk within each US state. The first data set looks at air pollution and particulate matter by state in the year 2020. While the second data set looks at acres burned and number of wildfires in each state in 2023. Both data sets create pretty insightful visualizations that show trends about the data.\nMircograms per Cubic meter (Pollution) by State:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia the NIH (National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities) Source: Link\nInsight: This plot shows the pollution trends across the continuous United States in the year 2020. The darker colors show states that are more polluted (higher micro grams per meter). While the lighter colors shows tates that are less polluted (lower micro grams per meter). The West Coast definitely has the highest amount of air pollution while Montana and the Dakotas have the least.\nMircograms per Cubic meter (Pollution) by State: Interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia the NHS ((National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities)) Source: Link\nRisk of Wildfires by State:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia the USDA (U.S Department of Agriculture) Source: Link\nInsight: This plot looks at each states risk of wildfires given previous data from 2023. This data takes the number of wildfires observed in 2023 and assigns them a categorical risk of either “Low”, “Medium”, “High, or”Very High” based on how many wildfires each state had. As shown the highest states are as expected (California, Texas, Washington, Oregon) due to them having large dry areas within there state. The lowest comes from the Midwest states and the upper New England area.\nRisk of Wildfires by State: Interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia the USDA (U.S Department of Agriculture) Source: Link"
